                </h2>
                <p><span class="accent">Introduction</span> Social computing refers to the study, design, and implementation of computational systems that facilitates social interactions and collaboration among individuals or groups. It encompasses technologies like social media, online communities, and most recently artificial intelligence (AI). In the hopes of creating an online space where Wellesley students can freely ask questions and exchange information about student and academic life, we chose to implement an asynchronous Q&A-based social platform.
                <br>
                The concept for Wellesley Asks Nico was inspired by the Wellesley FAQ Facebook Group created by Wellesley students, where students who are part of the Wellesley community are able to ask questions to fellow classmates and alums. However, we also brainstormed several unique features to make our platform more intuitive and useful, including a tagging system and an AI response generator, which we have dubbed as Nico. Feedback collected from two rounds of user testing and evaluation suggests that there exists interest among the student population for such platforms for browsing and interacting with frequently asked questions. Testers expressed a general appreciation for the ease of navigation and the tag filtering system, although some improvements, such as the implementation of a search function and direct messaging to facilitate stronger social ties, could still be made.
