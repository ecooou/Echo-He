                      <p class="card-text">College students often face high levels of stress from long hours and looming deadlines, which can lead to serious mental health issues like anxiety and depression. At the same time, there's a growing trend of students collecting comforting toys, such as Jellycats, for stress relief. Our research explores using these toys as tangible user interfaces (TUIs) to support student well-being. Unlike digital self-care apps that can feel intrusive, TUIs offer a physical, engaging, and non-disruptive way to promote self-care, using the comforting presence of toys to encourage stress-reducing habits.</p>
